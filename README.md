# MonoJet-Code

This houses the Monojet analysis code used from 2018-2020 in my undergrad research at University of Wisconsin-Madison

This code was used to analyze Monojet samples in a dark matter search using the aforementioned single jet with missing transverse energy.

It was originally built around the computing servers at University of Wisconsin-Madison, which is why you will see Condor-related files. Those files would be used to submit the comnputing jobs to the server to analyze through the hundreds of thousands of events in each region. 

Once the computing was done, it would ouput root files, which would then be used to plot various histograms (using the PlotTool directory)

This code was used for the 2018 run of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, specifically the CMS project. This was the primary year that I worked on while at the University.
